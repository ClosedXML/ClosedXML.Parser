## Unreleased

### Changed

- Forked from ClosedXML.Parser 2.0.0 and published as `XLibur.ClosedXML.Parser`. The
  `ClosedXML.Parser` namespace is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Write formula numbers with the invariant culture. `ToR1C1` used the current culture's
  negative sign, so under sv-SE, fi-FI or nb-NO (negative sign U+2212) it emitted
  `RC[−1]`, which the R1C1 reader could not parse back. Upstream issue
  [ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser#30](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser/issues/30).
- Parse a keyword list that is a whole inner reference.
